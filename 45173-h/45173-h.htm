<br />
<br />
The painted Briton built his mound,<br />
And left his celts and clay,<br />
On yon fair slope of sunlit ground<br />
That fronts your garden gay;<br />
The Roman came, he bore the sway,<br />
He bullied, bought, and sold,<br />
Your fountain sweeps his works away<br />
Beside your manor old!<br />
<br />
But still his crumbling urns are found<br />
Within the window-bay,<br />
Where once he listened to the sound<br />
That lulls you day by day;&mdash;<br />
The sound of summer winds at play,<br />
The noise of waters cold<br />
To Yarty wandering on their way,<br />
Beside your manor old!<br />
<br />
The Roman fell: his firm-set bound<br />
Became the Saxon's stay;<br />
The bells made music all around<br />
For monks in cloisters grey,<br />
Till fled the monks in disarray<br />
From their warm chantry's fold,<br />
The Abbots slumber as they may,<br />
Beside your manor old!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ENVOY</span>.<br />

Creeds, empires, peoples, all decay,<br />
Down into darkness, rolled;<br />
May life that's fleet be sweet, I pray,<br />

"All these for Fourpence."<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, where are the endless Romances<br />
Our grandmothers used to adore?<br />
The Knights with their helms and their lances,<br />
Their shields and the favours they wore?<br />
And the Monks with their magical lore?<br />
They have passed to Oblivion and <i>Nox</i><br />
They have fled to the shadowy shore,&mdash;<br />
They are all in the Fourpenny Box!<br />
<br />
And where the poetical fancies<br />
Our fathers were fond of, of yore?<br />
The lyric's melodious expanses,<br />
The Epics in cantos a score?<br />
They have been and are not: no more<br />
Shall the shepherds drive silvery flocks,<br />
Nor the ladies their long words deplore,&mdash;<br />
They are all in the Fourpenny Box!<br />
<br />
And the Music! The songs and the dances?<br />
The tunes that Time may not restore?<br />
And the tomes where Divinity prances?<br />
And the pamphlets where Heretics roar?<br />
They have ceased to be even a bore,&mdash;<br />
The Divine, and the Sceptic who mocks,&mdash;<br />
They are "cropped," they are "foxed" to core,&mdash;<br />
They are all in the Fourpenny Box!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ENVOY</span>.<br />
<br />
Suns beat on them; tempests downpour,<br />
On the chest without cover or locks,<br />
Where they lie by the Bookseller's door,&mdash;<br />
They are all in the Fourpenny Box!<br />

<a id="BALLADE_OF_BLUE_CHINA"></a>BALLADE OF BLUE CHINA<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a joy without canker or cark,<br />
There's a pleasure eternally new,<br />
'T is to gloat on the glaze and the mark<br />
Of china that's ancient and blue;<br />
Unchipp'd, all the centuries through<br />
It has pass'd, since the chime of it rang,<br />
And they fashion'd it, figure and hue,<br />
In the reign of the Emperor Hwang.<br />
<br />
These dragons (their tails, you remark,<br />
Into bunches of gillyflowers grew),&mdash;<br />
When Noah came out of the ark,<br />
Did these lie in wait for his crew?<br />
They snorted, they snapp'd, and they slew,<br />
They were mighty of fin and of fang,<br />
And their portraits Celestials drew<br />
In the reign of the Emperor Hwangs.<br />
<br />
Here's a pot with a cot in a park,<br />
In a park where the peach-blossoms blew,<br />
Where the lovers eloped in the dark,<br />
Lived, died, and were changed into two<br />
Bright birds that eternally flew<br />
Through the boughs of the may, as they sang;<br />
'T is a tale was undoubtedly true<br />
In the reign of the Emperor Hwang.<br />

Come, snarl at my ecstasies, do,<br />
Kind critic; your "tongue has a tang,"<br />

<br />
In torrid heats of late July,<br />
In March, beneath the bitter <i>bise</i>,<br />
He book-hunts while the loungers fly,&mdash;<br />
He book-hunts, though December freeze;<br />
In breeches baggy at the knees,<br />
And heedless of the public jeers,<br />
For these, for these, he hoards his fees,&mdash;<br />
Aldines, Bodonis, Elzevirs.<br />
<br />
No dismal stall escapes his eye,<br />
He turns o'er tomes of low degrees,<br />
There soiled romanticists may lie,<br />
Or Restoration comedies;<br />
Each tract that flutters in the breeze<br />
For him is charged with hopes and fears,<br />
In mouldy novels fancy sees<br />
Aldines, Bodonis, Elzevirs.<br />
<br />
With restless eyes that peer and spy,<br />
Sad eyes that heed not skies nor trees,<br />
In dismal nooks he loves to pry,<br />
Whose motto ever more is <i>Spes</i>!<br />
But ah! the fabled treasure flees;<br />
Grown rarer with the fleeting years,<br />
In rich men's shelves they take their ease,&mdash;<br />
Aldines, Bodonis, Elzevirs!<br />

<br />
Ah! leave the smoke, the wealth, the roar<br />
Of London, leave the bustling street,<br />
For still, by the Sicilian shore,<br />
The murmur of the Muse is sweet.<br />
Still, still, the suns of summer greet<br />
The mountain-grave of Helikê,<br />
And shepherds still their songs repeat<br />
Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea.<br />
<br />
What though they worship Pan no more,<br />
That guarded once the shepherd's seat,<br />
They chatter of their rustic lore,<br />
They watch the wind among the wheat:<br />
Cicalas chirp, the young lambs bleat,<br />
Where whispers pine to cypress tree;<br />
They count the waves that idly beat<br />
Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea.<br />
<br />
Theocritus! thou canst restore<br />
The pleasant years, and over-fleet;<br />
With thee we live as men of yore,<br />
We rest where running waters meet:<br />
And then we turn unwilling feet<br />
And seek the world&mdash;so must it be&mdash;<br />
<i>We</i> may not linger in the heat<br />
Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea!<br />

Master,&mdash;when rain, and snow, and sleet<br />
And northern winds are wild, to thee<br />
We come, we rest in thy retreat,<br />
Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea!<br />

Te soft wind from the south land sped,<br />
He set his strength to blow,<br />
From forests where Adonis bled,<br />
And lily flowers a-row:<br />
He crossed the straits like streams that flow,<br />
The ocean dark as wine,<br />
To my true love to whisper low,<br />
To be your Valentine.<br />
<br />
The Spring half-raised her drowsy head,<br />
Besprent with drifted snow,<br />
"I'll send an April day," she said,<br />
"To lands of wintry woe."<br />
He came,&mdash;the winter's overthrow,&mdash;<br />
With showers that sing and shine,<br />
Pied daisies round your path to strow,<br />
To be your Valentine.<br />
<br />
Where sands of Egypt, swart and red,<br />
'Neath suns Egyptian glow,<br />
In places of the princely dead,<br />
By the Nile's overflow,<br />
The swallow preened her wings to go,<br />
And for the North did pine,<br />
And fain would brave the frost, her foe,<br />
To be your Valentine.<br />

<br />
When strawberry pottles are common and cheap,<br />
Ere elms be black, or limes be sere,<br />
When midnight dances are murdering sleep,<br />
Then comes in the sweet o' the year!<br />
And far from Fleet street, far from here,<br />
The Summer is Queen in the length of the land,<br />
And moonlit nights they are soft and clear,<br />
When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand!<br />
<br />
When clamour that doves in the lindens keep<br />
Mingles with musical plash of the weir,<br />
Where drowned green tresses of crowsfoot creep,<br />
Then comes in the sweet o' the year!<br />
And better a crust and a beaker of beer,<br />
With rose-hung hedges on either hand,<br />
Than a palace in town and a prince's cheer,<br />
When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand!<br />
<br />
When big trout late in the twilight leap,<br />
When cuckoo clamoureth far and near,<br />
When glittering scythes in the hayfield reap,<br />
Then comes in the sweet o' the year!<br />
And it's oh to sail, with the wind to steer,<br />
While kine knee deep in the water stand,<br />
On a Highland loch, on a Lowland mere,<br />
When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ENVOY</span>.<br />
<br />
Friend, with the fops, while we dawdle here,<br />
Then comes in the sweet o' the year!<br />
And the Summer runs out, like grains of sand,<br />
When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand!<br />

<br />
<br />
We built a castle in the air,<br />
In summer weather, you and I,<br />
The wind and sun were in your hair,&mdash;<br />
Gold hair against a sapphire sky:<br />
When Autumn came, with leaves that fly<br />
Before the storm, across the plain,<br />
You fled from me, with scarce a sigh&mdash;<br />
My Love returns no more again!<br />
<br />
The windy lights of Autumn flare:<br />
I watch the moonlit sails go by;<br />
I marvel how men toil and fare,<br />
The weary business that they ply!<br />
Their voyaging is vanity,<br />
And fairy gold is all their gain,<br />
And all the winds of winter cry,<br />
"My Love returns no more again!"<br />
<br />
Here, in my castle of Despair,<br />
I sit alone with memory;<br />
The wind-fed wolf has left his lair,<br />
To keep the outcast company.<br />
The brooding owl he hoots hard by,<br />
<i>The hare shall kindle on thy hearth-stane</i>,<br />
The Rhymer's soothest prophecy,&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />

I know Cythera long is desolate;<br />
I know the winds have stripp'd the gardens green.<br />
Alas, my friends! beneath the fierce sun's weight<br />
A barren reef lies where Love's flowers have been,<br />
Nor ever lover on that coast is seen!<br />
So be it, but we seek a fabled shore,<br />
To lull our vague desires with mystic lore,<br />
To wander where Love's labyrinths beguile;<br />
There let us land, there dream for evermore:<br />
"It may be we shall touch the happy isle."<br />
<br />
The sea may be our sepulchre. If Fate,<br />
If tempests wreak their wrath on us, serene<br />
We watch the bolt of heaven, and scorn the hate<br />
Of angry gods that smite us in their spleen,<br />
Perchance the jealous mists are but the screen<br />
That veils the fairy coast we would explore.<br />
Come, though the sea be vex'd, and breakers roar,<br />
Come, for the air of this old world is vile,<br />
Haste we, and toil, and faint not at the oar;<br />
"It may be we shall touch the happy isle."<br />
<br />
Grey serpents trail in temples desecrate<br />
Where Cypris smiled, the golden maid, the queen,<br />
And ruined is the palace of our state;<br />
But happy Loves flit round the mast, and keen<br />
The shrill wind sings the silken cords between.<br />
Heroes are we, with wearied hearts and sore,<br />
Whose flower is faded and whose locks are hoar,<br />
Yet haste, light skiffs, where myrtle thickets smile<br />
Love's panthers sleep 'mid roses, as of yore:<br />
"It may be we shall touch the happy isle!"<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clear mirrored in the wet sea-sand.</span><br />
<br />
O, ruined chapel, long ago<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We loitered idly where the tall</span><br />
Fresh budded mountain ashes blow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within thy desecrated wall:</span><br />
<br />
The tough roots broke the tomb below,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The April birds sang clamorous,</span><br />
We did not dream, we could not know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How soon the Fates would sunder us!</span><br />
<br />
O, broken minster, looking forth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the bay, above the town,</span><br />
O, 'winter of the kindly North,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O, college of the scarlet gown,</span><br />
And shining sands beside the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stretch of links beyond the sand,</span><br />
Once more I watch you, and to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is as if I touched his hand!</span><br />
<br />
And therefore art thou yet more dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O, little city, grey and sere,</span><br />
Though shrunken from thine ancient pride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lonely by thy lonely sea,</span><br />
Than these fair halls on Isis' side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Youth an hour came back to me</span><br />
<br />
A land of waters green and clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of willows and of poplars tall,</span><br />
And, in the spring time of the year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The white may breaking over all,</span><br />
<br />
And Pleasure quick to come at call.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And summer rides by marsh and wold,</span><br />
And Autumn with her crimson pall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About the towers of Magdalen<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> rolled;</span><br />
And strange enchantments from the past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And memories of the friends of old,</span><br />
And strong Tradition, binding fast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The "flying terms" with bands of gold,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
All these hath Oxford: all are dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But dearer far the little town,</span><br />
The drifting surf, the wintry year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The college of the scarlet gown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>St. Andrews by the Northern sea</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That is a haunted town to me</i>!</span><br />

'Serai-je nonnette, oui ou non?<br />

Derrière chez mon père<br />
Il est un bois taillis,<br />
Le rossignol y chante<br />
Et le jour et la nuit<br />
Il chante pour les filles<br />
Qui n'ont pas d'ami;<br />
Il ne chante pas pour moi,<br />

I 'll never be a nun, I trow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While apple bloom is white as snow.</span><br />
But far more fair to see;<br />
I 'll never wear nun's black and white<br />
While nightingales make sweet the night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the apple tree.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, listen! 'tis the nightingale,<br />
And in the wood he makes his wail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the apple tree;</span><br />
He singeth of the sore distress<br />
Of many ladies loverless;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thank God, no song for me.</span><br />
<br />
For when the broad May moon is low,<br />
A gold fruit seen where blossoms blow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the boughs of the apple tree,</span><br />
A step I know is at the gate;<br />
Ah love, but it is long to wait<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until night's noon bring thee!</span><br />
<br />
Between lark's song and nightingale's<br />
A silent space, while dawning pales,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The birds leave still and free</span><br />
For words and kisses musical,<br />
For silence and for sighs that fall<br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOR A SKETCH BY MR. G. LESLIE, A.R.A.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
France your country, as we know;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Room enough for guessing yet,</span><br />
What lips now or long ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kissed and named you&mdash;Colinette.</span><br />
In what fields from sea to sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By what stream your home was set,</span><br />
Loire or Seine was glad of thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Marne or Rhone, O Colinette?</span><br />
<br />
Did you stand with "maidens ten,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fairer maids were never seen,"</span><br />
When the young king and his men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed among the orchards green?</span><br />
Nay, old ballads have a note<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mournful, we would fain forget;</span><br />
No such sad old air should float<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round your young brows, Colinette.</span><br />
<br />
Say, did Ronsard sing to you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shepherdess, to lull his pain,</span><br />
When the court went wandering through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rose pleasances of Touraine?</span><br />
Ronsard and his famous Rose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long are dust the breezes fret;</span><br />
You, within the garden close,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are blooming, Colinette.</span><br />
<br />
Have I seen you proud and gay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a patched and perfumed beau,</span><br />
Dancing through the summer day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Misty summer of Watteau?</span><br />
Nay, so sweet a maid as you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never walked a minuet</span><br />
With the splendid courtly crew;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay, forgive me, Colinette.</span><br />
<br />
Not from Greuze's canvasses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do you cast a glance, a smile;</span><br />
You are not as one of these,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yours is beauty without guile.</span><br />
Round your maiden brows and hair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Maidenhood and Childhood met,</span><br />
Crown and kiss you, sweet and fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">New art's blossom, Colinette.</span><br />

Returning from what other seas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dost thou renew thy murmuring,</span><br />
Weak Tide, and hast thou aught of these<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To tell, the shores where float and cling</span><br />
My love, my hope, my memories?<br />
<br />
Say does my lady wake to note<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gold light into silver die?</span><br />
Or do thy waves make lullaby,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While dreams of hers, like angels, float</span><br />
Through star-sown spaces of the sky?<br />
<br />
Ah, would such angels came to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That dreams of mine might speak with hers,</span><br />
Nor wake the slumber of the sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With words as low as winds that be</span><br />
Awake among the gossamers!<br />

The grave is wide and deep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sunders you and me;</span><br />
In bitter dreams we reap<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sorrow we have sown,</span><br />
And I would I were asleep,<br />

<br />
We knew and did not know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We saw and did not see,</span><br />
The nets that long ago<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fate wove for you and me;</span><br />
The cruel nets that keep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The birds that sob and moan,</span><br />

The dear remembered melody<br />

<br />
Wan water from the border hills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear voice from the old years,</span><br />
Thy distant music lulls and stills,<br />

Like a loved ghost thy fabled flood<br />

Where Scott, come home to die, has stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My feet returning stand.</span><br />
<br />
A mist of memory broods and floats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The border waters flow;</span><br />
The air is full of ballad notes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne out of long ago.</span><br />
<br />
Old songs that sung themselves to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet through a boy's day dream,</span><br />
While trout below the blossom'd tree<br />

The silk sail fills, the soft winds wake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Arise and tempt the seas;</span><br />
Our ocean is the Palace lake,<br />
Our waves the ripples that we make<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among the mirrored trees.</span><br />

Nay, sweet the shore, and sweet the song,<br />

The music mingled all day long<br />
With paces of the dancing throng,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And murmur of the stream.</span><br />
<br />
An hour ago, an hour ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We rested in the shade;</span><br />
And now, why should we seek to know<br />
What way the wilful waters flow?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no fairer glade.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">LUI</span>.<br />

Nay, pleasure flits, and we must sail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seek him everywhere;</span><br />
Perchance in sunset's golden pale<br />
He listens to the nightingale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid the perfumed air.</span><br />
<br />
Come, he has fled; you are not you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I no more am I;</span><br />
Delight is changeful as the hue<br />
Of heaven, that is no longer blue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In yonder sunset sky.</span><br />

Nay, if we seek we shall not find,<br />

Nay, see, the sunset fades behind<br />
The mountains, and the cold night wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blows from the house of Death.</span><br />

My Love dwelt in a Northern land.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A grey tower in a forest green</span><br />
Was his, and far on either hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The long wash of the waves was seen,</span><br />
And leagues on leagues of yellow sand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The woven forest boughs between!</span><br />
<br />
And through the clear faint Northern night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sunset slowly died away,</span><br />
And herds of strange deer, silver-white,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stole forth among the branches grey;</span><br />
About the coming of the light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They fled like ghosts before the day!</span><br />
<br />
I know not if the forest green<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still girdles round that castle grey;</span><br />
I know not if the boughs between<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The white deer vanish ere the day;</span><br />
Above my Love the grass is green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart is colder than the clay!</span><br />

The wind and the day had lived together,<br />

Spoke farewell in the sultry weather,<br />
Out of the sunset, over the heather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dying wind and the dying day.</span><br />
<br />
Far in the south, the summer levin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flushed, a flame in the grey soft air:</span><br />
We seemed to look on the hills of heaven;<br />
You saw within, but to me 'twas given<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see your face, as an angel's, there.</span><br />
<br />
Never again, ah surely never,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall we wait and watch, where of old we stood,</span><br />
The low good-night of the hill and the river,<br />
The faint light fade, and the wan stars quiver,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twain grown one in the solitude.</span><br />

<a id="A_PORTRAIT_OF_1783"></a>A PORTRAIT OF 1783.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your hair and chin are like the hair<br />
And chin Burne-Jones's ladies wear;<br />
You were unfashionably fair<br />
And sad you were when girls are gay,<br />
You read a book about <i>Le vrai</i><br />
<i>Mérite de l'homme</i>, alone in May.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">What <i>can</i> it be,</span><br />
<i>Le vrai mérite de l'homme?</i> Not gold,<br />
Not titles that are bought and sold,<br />
Not wit that flashes and is cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">But Virtue merely!</span><br />
Instructed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br />
(And Jean-Jacques, surely, ought to know),<br />
You bade the crowd of foplings go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">You glanced severely,</span><br />
Dreaming beneath the spreading shade<br />
Of "that vast hat the Graces made";<a name="FNanchor_2_6" id="FNanchor_2_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_6" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><br />
So Rouget sang&mdash;while yet he played<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">With courtly rhyme,</span><br />
And hymned great Doisi's red perruque,<br />
And Nice's eyes, and Zulmé's look,<br />
And dead canaries, ere he shook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">The sultry time</span><br />
With strains like thunder. Loud and low<br />
Methinks I hear the murmur grow,<br />
The tramp of men that come and go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">With fire and sword.</span><br />
They war against the quick and dead,<br />
Their flying feet are dashed with red,<br />
As theirs the vintaging that tread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Before the Lord.</span><br />
O head unfashionably fair,<br />
What end was thine, for all thy care?<br />
We only see thee dreaming there:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">We cannot see</span><br />
The breaking of thy vision, when<br />
The Rights of Man were lords of men,<br />
When virtue won her own again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">In '93.</span><br />

<p class="p4">
<a id="THE_BARBAROUS_BIRD-GODS_A_SAVAGE_PARABASIS"></a>THE BARBAROUS BIRD-GODS: A SAVAGE PARABASIS.<br />
<br />
[The myth in the "Birds" of Aristophanes, which represents Birds as older<br />
than the Gods, may have been a genuine Greek tradition. The following<br />
lines show how prevalent is the myth among widely severed races. The<br />
Mexican Bird-gods I omit; who can rhyme to Huitzilopochtli?]<br />
<br />
<i>The Birds Sing</i>:<br />
<br />
We would have you to wit, that on eggs though<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">we sit, and are spiked on the spit, and are baked</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">in the pan,</span><br />
Birds are older by far than your ancestors are, and made<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">love and made war ere the making of Man!</span><br />
For when all things were dark, not a glimmer nor spark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and the world like a barque without rudder or sail</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Floated on through the night, 't was a Bird struck a</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">light, 't was a flash from the bright feather'd Tonatiu's<a name="FNanchor_3_7" id="FNanchor_3_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_7" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">tail!</span><br />
Then the Hawk<a name="FNanchor_4_8" id="FNanchor_4_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_8" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with some dry wood flew up in the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">sky, and afar, safe and high, the Hawk lit Sun and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Moon,</span><br />
And the Birds of the air they rejoiced everywhere, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">they recked not of care that should come on them</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">soon.</span><br />
For the Hawk, so they tell, was then known as Pundjel,<a name="FNanchor_5_9" id="FNanchor_5_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_9" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and a-musing he fell at the close of the day;</span><br />
Then he went on the quest, as we thought, of a nest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">with some bark of the best, and a clawful of clay,<a name="FNanchor_6_10" id="FNanchor_6_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_10" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span><br />
And with these did he frame two birds lacking a name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">without feathers (his game was a puzzle to all);</span><br />
Next around them he fluttered a-dancing, and muttered;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and, lastly, he uttered a magical call:</span><br />
Then the figures of clay, as they featherless lay, they<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">leaped up, who but they, and embracing they fell,</span><br />
And <i>this</i> was the baking of Man, and his making; but<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">now he's forsaking his Father, Pundjel!</span><br />
Now these creatures of mire, they kept whining for fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and to crown their desire who was found but the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wren?</span><br />
<br />
To the high heaven he came, from the Sun stole he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">flame, and for this has a name in the memory of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">men!<a name="FNanchor_7_11" id="FNanchor_7_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_11" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span><br />
And in India who for the Soma juice flew, and to men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">brought it through without falter or fail?</span><br />
Why the Hawk 't was again, and great Indra to men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">would appear, now and then, in the shape of a Quail,</span><br />
While the Thlinkeet's delight is the Bird of the Night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the beak and the bright ebon plumage of Yehl.<a name="FNanchor_8_12" id="FNanchor_8_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_12" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span><br />
And who for man's need brought the famed Suttung's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">mead? why 't is told in the creed of the Sagamen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">strong,</span><br />
'T was the Eagle god who brought the drink from the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">blue, and gave mortals the brew that's the fountain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">of song.<a name="FNanchor_9_13" id="FNanchor_9_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_13" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span><br />
Next, who gave men their laws? and what reason or<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">cause the young brave overawes when in need of a</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">squaw,</span><br />
Till he thinks it a shame to wed one of his name, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">his conduct you blame if he thus breaks the law?</span><br />
For you still hold it wrong if a <i>lubra</i><a name="FNanchor_10_14" id="FNanchor_10_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_14" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> belong to the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">self-same <i>kobong</i><a name="FNanchor_11_15" id="FNanchor_11_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_15" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that is Father of you,</span><br />
To take <i>her</i> as a bride to your ebony side; nay, you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">give her a wide berth; quite right of you, too.</span><br />
For <i>her</i> father, you know, is <i>your</i> father, the Crow, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">no blessing but woe from the wedding would spring.</span><br />
Well, these rules they were made in the wattle-gum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">shade, and were strictly obeyed, when the Crow was</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the King.<a name="FNanchor_12_16" id="FNanchor_12_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_16" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span><br />
Thus on Earth's little ball to the Birds you owe all, yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">your gratitude's small for the favours they've done,</span><br />
And their feathers you pill, and you eat them at will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">yes, you plunder and kill the bright birds one by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">one;</span><br />
There 's a price on their head, and the Dodo is dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and the Moa has fled from the sight of the sun!</span><br />

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;"><a id="HESPEROTHEN"></a>HESPEROTHEN.</p>

<p>By the example of certain Grecian mariners, who, being safely returned from
the war about Troy, leave yet again their old lands and gods, seeking they
know not what, and choosing neither to abide in the fair Phæacian island,
nor to dwell and die with the Sirens, at length end miserably in a desert
country by the sea, is set forth the <i>Vanity of Melancholy</i>. And by the land
of Phæacia is to be understood the place of Art and of fair Pleasures; and
by Circe's Isle, the places of bodily delights, whereof men, falling aweary
attain to Eld, and to the darkness of that age. Which thing Master Françoys
Rabelais feigned, under the similitude of the Isle of the Macræones.</p></blockquote>

<a id="THE_SEEKERS_FOR_PHAEACIA"></a>THE SEEKERS FOR PHÆACIA.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a land in the remotest day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the soft night is born, and sunset dies;</span><br />
The eastern shores see faint tides fade away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wash the lands where laughter, tears, and sighs,</span><br />
Make life,&mdash;the lands beneath the blue of common, skies.<br />
<br />
But in the west is a mysterious sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(What sails have seen it, or what shipmen known?)</span><br />
With coasts enchanted where the Sirens be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With islands where a Goddess walks alone,</span><br />
And in the cedar trees the magic winds make moan.<br />
<br />
Eastward the human cares of house and home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cities, and ships, and unknown Gods, and loves;</span><br />
Westward, strange maidens fairer than the foam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lawless lives of men, and haunted groves,</span><br />
Wherein a God may dwell, and where the Dryad roves.<br />
<br />
The Gods are careless of the days and death<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of toilsome men, beyond the western seas;</span><br />
The Gods are heedless of their painful breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And love them not, for they are not as these;</span><br />
But in the golden west they live and lie at ease.<br />
<br />
Yet the Phæacians well they love, who live<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the light's limit, passing careless hours,</span><br />
Most like the Gods; and they have gifts to give,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even wine, and fountains musical, and flowers,</span><br />
And song, and if they will, swift ships, and magic powers.<br />
<br />
It is a quiet midland; in the cool<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of twilight comes the God, though no man prayed,</span><br />
To watch the maids and young men beautiful<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dance, and they see him, and are not afraid,</span><br />
For they are near of kin to Gods, and undismayed.<br />
<br />
Ah, would the bright red prows might bring us nigh<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dreamy isles that the Immortals keep!</span><br />
But with a mist they hide them wondrously,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And far the path and dim to where they sleep,&mdash;</span><br />
The loved, the shadowy lands along the shadowy deep.<br />

Why will you seek the shadows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the ocean stream?</span><br />

Through straits of storm and peril,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through firths unsailed before,</span><br />
Why make you for the sterile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dark Kimmerian shore?</span><br />
<br />
There no bright streams are flowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There day and night are one,</span><br />
No harvest time, no sowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No sight of any sun;</span><br />
<br />
No sound of song or tabor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No dance shall greet you there;</span><br />
No noise of mortal labour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breaks on the blind chill air.</span><br />

Are ours not happy places,<br />
Where Gods with mortals trod?<br />
Saw not our sires the faces<br />
Of many a present God?<br />

Nay, now no God comes hither,<br />

They fare we know not whither,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We know not what they be.</span><br />
<br />
Yea, though the sunset lingers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far in your fairy glades,</span><br />
Though yours the sweetest singers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though yours the kindest maids,</span><br />
<br />
Yet here be the true shadows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here in the doubtful light;</span><br />
Amid the dreamy meadows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No shadow haunts the night.</span><br />
<br />
We seek a city splendid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With light beyond the sun;</span><br />
Or lands where dreams are ended,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And works and days are done.</span><br />

<br />
Fair white bird, what song art thou singing<br />
In wintry weather of lands o'er sea?<br />
Dear white bird, what way art thou winging,<br />
Where no grass grows, and no green tree ?<br />
<br />
I looked at the far off fields and grey,<br />
There grew no tree but the cypress tree,<br />
That bears sad fruits with the flowers of May,<br />
And whoso looks on it, woe is he.<br />
<br />
And whoso eats of the fruit thereof<br />
Has no more sorrow, and no more love;<br />
And who sets the same in his garden stead,<br />
In a little space he is waste and dead.<br />
<br />
We seek a city splendid,<br />

<br />
The weary sails a moment slept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The oars were silent for a space,</span><br />
As past Hesperian shores we swept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That were as a remembered face</span><br />
Seen after lapse of hopeless years,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Hades, when the shadows meet,</span><br />
Dim through the mist of many tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And strange, and though a shadow, sweet.</span><br />
<br />
So seemed the half-remembered shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That slumbered, mirrored in the blue,</span><br />
With havens where we touched of yore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ports that over well we knew.</span><br />
Then broke the calm before a breeze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sought the secret of the west;</span><br />
And listless all we swept the seas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Towards the Islands of the Blest.</span><br />
<br />
Beside a golden sanded bay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We saw the Sirens, very fair</span><br />
The flowery hill whereon they lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flowers set upon their hair.</span><br />
Their old sweet song came down the wind.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remembered music waxing strong,</span><br />
Ah now no need of cords to bind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No need had we of Orphic song.</span><br />
<br />
It once had seemed a little thing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To lay our lives down at their feet,</span><br />
That dying we might hear them sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dying see their faces sweet;</span><br />
But now, we glanced, and passing by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No care had we to tarry long;</span><br />
Faint hope, and rest, and memory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were more than any Siren's song.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
Ah, Circe, Circe! in the wood we cried;<br />
Ah, Circe, Circe! but no voice replied;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No voice from bowers o'ergrown and ruinous</span><br />
As fallen rocks upon the mountain side.<br />
<br />
There was no sound of singing in the air;<br />
Faded or fled the maidens that were fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No more for sorrow or joy were seen of us,</span><br />
No light of laughing eyes, or floating hair.<br />
<br />
The perfume, and the music, and the flame<br />
Had passed away; the memory of shame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alone abode, and stings of faint desire,</span><br />
And pulses of vague quiet went and came.<br />
<br />
Ah, Circe! in thy sad changed fairy place,<br />
Our dead Youth came and looked on us a space,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With drooping wings, and eyes of faded fire,</span><br />
And wasted hair about a weary face.<br />
<br />
Why had we ever sought the magic isle<br />
That seemed so happy in the days erewhile?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why did we ever leave it, where we met</span><br />
A world of happy wonders in one smile?<br />
<br />
Back to the westward and the waning light<br />
We turned, we fled; the solitude of night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was better than the infinite regret,</span><br />
In fallen places of our dead delight.<br />

<br />
Between the circling ocean sea<br />
And the poplars of Persephone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There lies a strip of barren sand,</span><br />
Flecked with the sea's last spray, and strown<br />
With waste leaves of the poplars, blown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From gardens of the shadow land.</span><br />
<br />
With altars of old sacrifice<br />
The shore is set, in mournful wise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mists upon the ocean brood;</span><br />
Between the water and the air<br />
The clouds are born that float and fare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Between the water and the wood.</span><br />
<br />
Upon the grey sea never sail<br />
Of mortals passed within our hail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the last weak waves faint and flow;</span><br />
We heard within the poplar pale<br />
The murmur of a doubtful wail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of voices loved so long ago.</span><br />
<br />
We scarce had care to die or live,<br />
We had no honey cake to give,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No wine of sacrifice to shed;</span><br />
There lies no new path over sea,<br />
And now we know how faint they be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The feasts and voices of the Dead.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, flowers and dance! ah, sun and snow!<br />
Glad life, sad life we did forego<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dream of quietness and rest;</span><br />
Ah, would the fleet sweet roses here<br />
Poured light and perfume through the drear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pale year, and wan land of the west.</span><br />
<br />
Sad youth, that let the spring go by<br />
Because the spring is swift to fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sad youth, that feared to mourn or love,</span><br />
Behold how sadder far is this,<br />
To know that rest is nowise bliss,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And darkness is the end thereof.</span><br />

<a id="THE_SHADE_OF_HELEN"></a>THE SHADE OF HELEN.<br />

<br />
Some say that Helen went never to Troy, but abode in<br />
Egypt; for the Gods, having made in her semblance a<br />
woman out of clouds and shadows, sent the same to be<br />
wife to Paris. For this shadow then the Greeks and<br />
Trojans slew each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
(<i>Written in the Pyrenees</i>.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Why from the quiet hollows of the hills,<br />
And extreme meeting place of light and shade,<br />
Wherein soft rains fell slowly, and became<br />
Clouds among sister clouds, where fair spent beams<br />
And dying glories of the sun would dwell,'<br />
Why have they whom I know not, nor may know,<br />
Strange hands, unseen and ruthless, fashioned me,<br />
And borne me from the silent shadowy hills,<br />
Hither, to noise and glow of alien life,<br />
To harsh and clamorous swords, and sound of war?<br />
One speaks unto me words that would be sweet,<br />
Made harsh, made keen with love that knows me not,<br />
And some strange force, within me or around,<br />
<br />
Makes answer, kiss for kiss, and sigh for sigh,<br />
And somewhere there is fever in the halls,<br />
That troubles me, for no such trouble came<br />
To vex the cool far hollows of the hills.<br />
<br />
The foolish folk crowd round me, and they cry,<br />
That house, and wife, and lands, and all Troy town,<br />
Are little to lose, if they may hold me here,<br />
And see me flit, a pale and silent shade,<br />
<br />
Among the streets bereft, and helpless shrines.<br />
At other hours another life seems mine,<br />
Where one great river runs unswollen of rain,<br />
By pyramids of unremembered kings,<br />
And homes of men obedient to the Dead.<br />
There dark and quiet faces come and go<br />
Around me, then again the shriek of arms,<br />
And all the turmoil of the Ilian men.<br />
What are they? even shadows such as I.<br />
What make they? Even this&mdash;the sport of Gods&mdash;<br />
The sport of Gods, however free they seem.<br />
Ah would the game were ended, and the light,<br />
The blinding light, and all too mighty suns,<br />
Withdrawn, and I once more with sister shades,<br />
Unloved, forgotten, mingled with the mist,<br />
Dwelt in the hollows of the shadowy hills.<br />

The incident is from the Love Stories of Parthenius,<br />
who preserved fragments of a lost epic on the<br />
expedition of Achilles against Lesbos, an island<br />
allied with Troy.<br />
<br />
<br />
The daughter of the Lesbian king<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within her bower she watched the war,</span><br />
Far off she heard the arrows ring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The smitten harness ring afar;</span><br />
And, fighting from the foremost car,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saw one that smote where all must flee;</span><br />
More fair than the Immortals are<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He seemed to fair Pisidicê!</span><br />
<br />
She saw, she loved him, and her heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before Achilles, Peleus' son,</span><br />
Threw all its guarded gates apart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A maiden fortress lightly won!</span><br />
And, ere that day of fight was done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No more of land or faith recked she,</span><br />
But joyed in her new life begun,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her life of love, Pisidicê!</span><br />
<br />
She took a gift into her hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As one that had a boon to crave;</span><br />
She stole across the ruined land<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where lay the dead without a grave,</span><br />
And to Achilles' hand she gave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her gift, the secret postern's key.</span><br />
"To-morrow let me be thy slave!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Moaned to her love Pisidicê.</span><br />
<br />
Ere dawn the Argives' clarion call<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rang down Methymna's burning street;</span><br />
They slew the sleeping warriors all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They drove the women to the fleet,</span><br />
Save one, that to Achilles' feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clung, but, in sudden wrath, cried he:</span><br />
"For her no doom but death is meet."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there men stoned Pisidicê.</span><br />
<br />
In havens of that haunted coast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid the myrtles of the shore,</span><br />
The moon sees many a maiden ghost,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love's outcast now and evermore.</span><br />
The silence hears the shades deplore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their hour of dear-bought love; but <i>thee</i></span><br />
The waves lull, 'neath thine olives hoar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dreamless rest, Pisidicê!</span><br />

ensemble. Esmues du juste deuil de la perte de leur<br />
chère compagne, et enuyées jusques au desespoir,<br />

Till forth to seek Ætnæan buds they went,<br />

And they have sought her all the wide world through,<br />

And running rivers for the bitter brine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She left, and by the margin of life's sea</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sings, and her song is full of the sea's moan,</span><br />

They heard the hollows of the hills replying,<br />

When poets for a poet dead are sighing,<br />

Before us, that gay village, yellow and red,<br />

Flew forth, like Shelley's spirit, to the sea!<br />

To flit to flowers, as kinder and more fair,<br />
Are but torn love-letters, that through the skies<br />
Flutter, and float, and change to Butterflies.<br />

<br />
There is an air for which I would disown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mozart's, Rossini's, Weber's melodies,&mdash;</span><br />
A sweet sad air that languishes and sighs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And keeps its secret charm for me alone.</span><br />
<br />
Whene'er I hear that music vague and old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two hundred years are mist that rolls away;</span><br />
The thirteenth Louis reigns, and I behold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A green land golden in the dying* day.</span><br />
<br />
An old red castle, strong with stony towers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The windows gay with many coloured glass,</span><br />
Wide plains, and rivers flowing among flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bathe the castle basement as they pass.</span><br />
<br />
In antique weed, with dark eyes and gold hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A lady looks forth from her window high;</span><br />
It may be that I knew and found her fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In some forgotten life, long time gone by.</span><br />

Winter is passing, and the bells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For ever with their silver lay</span><br />
Murmur a melody that tells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of April and of Easter day.</span><br />
High in the sweet air the light vane sets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The weathercocks all southward twirl;</span><br />
A son will buy her violets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And make Nini a happy girl.</span><br />
<br />
The winter to the poor was sore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Counting the weary winter days,</span><br />
Watching his little fire-wood store,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bitter snow-flakes fell always;</span><br />
And now his last log dimly gleamed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lighting the room with feeble glare,</span><br />
Half cinder and half smoke it seemed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the wind wafted into air.</span><br />
<br />
Pilgrims from ocean and far isles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See where the east is reddening,</span><br />
The flocks that fly a thousand miles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From sunsetting to sunsetting;</span><br />
Look up, look out, behold the swallows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The throats that twitter, the wings that beat;</span><br />
And on their song the summer follows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the summer life is sweet.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shoot and sap of lusty spring</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her casement, see, is opening;</span><br />
Through all the bitter months that were,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forth from her nest she dared not flee,</span><br />
She was a study for Boucher,<br />

Louise, have you forgotten yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The corner of the flowery land,</span><br />
The ancient garden where we met,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My hand that trembled in your hand?</span><br />
Our lips found words scarce sweet enough,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As low beneath the willow-trees</span><br />
We sat; have you forgotten, love?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do you remember, love Louise?</span><br />
<br />
Marie, have you forgotten yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loving barter that we made?</span><br />
The rings we changed, the suns that set,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The woods fulfilled with sun and shade?</span><br />
The fountains that were musical<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By many an ancient trysting tree&mdash;</span><br />
Marie, have you forgotten all?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do you remember, love Marie?</span><br />
<br />
Christine, do you remember yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your room with scents and roses gay?</span><br />
My garret&mdash;near the sky't was set&mdash;<br />
The April hours, the nights of May?<br />
The clear calm nights&mdash;the stars above<br />
That whispered they were fairest seen<br />
Through no cloud-veil? Remember, love!<br />
Do you remember, love Christine?<br />
<br />
Louise is dead, and, well-a-day!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Marie a sadder path has ta'en;</span><br />
And pale Christine has passed away<br />
In southern suns to bloom again.<br />
Alas I for one and all of us&mdash;<br />
Marie, Louise, Christine forget;<br />
Our bower of love is ruinous,<br />
And I alone remember yet.<br />

I spoke to him and he nothing said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I gave him bread of the wheat so fine,</span><br />
He did not eat of the bridal bread,<br />

<br />
I made him a bed was soft and deep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I made him a bed to sleep with me;</span><br />
"Look on me once before you sleep,<br />

<br />
It was a mother and a maid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That walked the woods among,</span><br />
And still the maid went slow and sad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And still the mother sung.</span><br />
<br />
"What ails you, daughter Margaret?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why go you pale and wan?</span><br />
Is it for a cast of bitter love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or for a false leman?"</span><br />
<br />
"It is not for a false lover<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I go sad to see;</span><br />
But it is for a weary life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the greenwood tree.</span><br />
<br />
"For ever in the good daylight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A maiden may I go,</span><br />
But always on the ninth midnight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I change to a milk white doe.</span><br />
<br />
"They hunt me through the green forest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With hounds and hunting men;</span><br />

<br />
"Good-morrow, mother." "Good-morrow, son;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where are your hounds so good?"</span><br />
"Oh, they are hunting a white doe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the glad greenwood.</span><br />
<br />
"And three times have they hunted her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thrice she's won away;</span><br />

Then out and spoke the forester,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he came from the wood,</span><br />
"Now never saw I maid's gold hair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among the wild deer's blood.</span><br />
<br />
"And I have hunted the wild deer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In east lands and in west;</span><br />
And never saw I white doe yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That had a maiden's breast."</span><br />
<br />
Then up and spake her fair brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Between the wine and bread.</span><br />
"Behold, I had but one sister,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I have been her dead.</span><br />
<br />
"But ye must bury my sweet sister<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a stone at her foot and her head,</span><br />
And ye must cover her fair body<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the white roses and red.</span><br />
<br />
"And I must out to the greenwood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The roof shall never shelter me;</span><br />
And I shall lie for seven long years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the grass below the hawthorn tree."</span><br />
